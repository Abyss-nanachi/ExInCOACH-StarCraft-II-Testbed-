What's more, You need to see clearly whether an action is using screen coordinates or minimap coordinates, If an action name as XXXX_Screen, it uses screen coordinate; if an action name as XXXX_Minimap, it uses minimap coordinate.\n\nLast Step Actions:\n\tTeam Adept-1:\n\t\t<Hold_Position()>\n\tTeam AdeptPhase-1:\n\t\t<Attack_Unit(0x1012c0001)>\nYou need to confirm whether the previous action finished executing, and based on this, determine whether to continue the old strategy or immediately take other actions.\n\nTasks:\n\tTeam AdeptPhase-1' task: Kill as much as enemy workers as possible.\n\nGive each team no more than 3 actions, among which activity release should usually before move and attack.\nNow, start generating your analysis and actions:"}
