The shade has a sight radius of 2.\n\tZerg.Hatchery\n\t\tSpawns larvae to be morphed into other zerg strains, generates creep and digests minerals and gas into a usable form. The queen is spawned directly from the hatchery.\n\t\tUnit properties: ['ground', 'armored', 'biological', 'structure']\n\tZerg.Overlord\n\t\tProduces control and is no longer a detector like the StarCraft I version.\n\t\tUnit properties: ['air', 'armored', 'biological']\n\tZerg.Queen\n\t\tThe queen a powerful attacking ground dwelling support unit ideal for zerg defense.\n\t\tUnit properties: ['ground', 'biological', 'psionic']\n\t\tWeapon info: Attack Range 5, target: ['ground', 'air'], DPS(damage per second) 11\n\nValid Actions:\n\tTeam Adept-1 Valid Actions:\n\t\t<Stop()>\n\t\t<No_Operation()>\n\t\t<Hold_Position()>\n\t\t<Move_Minimap(minimap)>\n\t\t<Move_Screen(screen)>\n\t\t<Attack_Unit(tag)>\n\tTeam AdeptPhase-1 Valid Actions:\n\t\t<Stop()>\n\t\t<No_Operation()>\n\t\t<Hold_Position()>\n\t\t<Move_Minimap(minimap)>\n\t\t<Move_Screen(screen)>\n\nAction Args: \n\t(1) tag: tag refers to a hexadecimal number, shape as 0x000000000.\n\t(2) screen: screen refers to a screen coordinate, shape as [x, y], where x and y range from 0 to 128.\n\t(3) minimap: minimap refers to a minimap coordinate, shape as [x, y], where x and y range from 0 to 64.\nFor example, when you want to use an action like <Action_Name(tag, screen)>, you should output like <Action_Name(0x100580001, [37, 55])>; when you want to use an action like <Action_Name(screen)>, you should output like <Action_Name([66, 78])>. What's more, You need to see clearly whether an action is using screen coordinates or minimap coordinates, If an action name as XXXX_Screen, it uses screen coordinate; if an action name as XXXX_Minimap, it uses minimap coordinate.\n\nLast Step Actions:\n\tTeam AdeptPhase-1:\n\t\t<Move_Minimap([52, 32])>\n\tTeam Adept-1:\n\t\t<Move_Minimap([52, 32])>\nYou need to confirm whether the previous action finished executing, and based on this, determine whether to continue the old strategy or immediately take other actions.\n\nTasks:\n\tTeam Adept-1' task: Go to minimap coordinate [52, 32], and try to avoid been detected or attacked before arrival.\n\tTeam AdeptPhase-1' task: Go to minimap coordinate [52, 32], and try to avoid been detected or attacked before arrival.\n\nGive each team no more than 3 actions, among which activity release should usually before move and attack.\nNow, start generating your analysis and actions:"}
