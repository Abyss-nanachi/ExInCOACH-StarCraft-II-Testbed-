{"0": "Analysis: \n  Team Adept-1 is currently at the base near the Nexus with no enemies in the immediate vicinity. The tactical task is to move to the minimap coordinate [52, 32] while avoiding detection. Since the destination is far and the path is unknown, moving directly via the minimap is the safest approach to ensure the units stay together and react to any threats along the way, rather than using Psionic Transfer blindly which could teleport them into danger.\n\nActions:\n  Team Adept-1:\n    <Move_Minimap([52, 32])>"}

The Adepts should also move towards the target to close the distance and ensure they arrive promptly, either by walking or teleporting when the Shades reach the destination.
